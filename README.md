<br> Hello my self Himanshu Gangwar
<br>
This is my first machine learning project.
<br> Linear regression is a fundamental technique in statistics and machine learning.expand_more It's used to uncover the relationship between a dependent variable (what you're trying to predict) and one or more independent variables (what you're basing your prediction on)
<h1>Linear Regression Explained</h1>
    <p>Linear regression is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (what you're trying to predict) and one or more independent variables (what you're basing your prediction on).</p>
    <h2>Core Idea</h2>
    <p>Imagine you have data points consisting of paired values, like house size (independent variable) and price (dependent variable). Linear regression aims to find a straight line that best fits this data, allowing you to predict the price of a house based on its size.</p>
      <h2>Types of Linear Regression</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Simple Linear Regression</b>: Involves just one independent variable. This is the classic scenario where you draw a best-fit line through the data points.</li>
        <li><b>Multiple Linear Regression</b>: Deals with two or more independent variables. The model becomes a plane or hyperplane in higher dimensions, but the concept remains the same - finding the best fit for the data.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Process</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Data Collection</b>: Gather information with paired dependent and independent variables.</li>
        <li><b>Model Fitting</b>: The algorithm determines the equation of the best-fit line/plane by minimizing the errors between predicted and actual values.</li>
        <li><b>Evaluation</b>: The model's performance is assessed using metrics like R-squared, which indicates how well the data fits the line.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Applications</h2>
    <p>Linear regression finds applications in various fields, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Business</b>: Predicting sales figures based on marketing campaigns.</li>
        <li><b>Finance</b>: Forecasting stock prices based on market trends.</li>
        <li><b>Science</b>: Analyzing the relationship between variables in experiments.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Advantages</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Easy to interpret</b>: The resulting equation provides a clear understanding of how the independent variables affect the dependent variable.</li>
        <li><b>Relatively simple to implement</b>: Linear regression algorithms are well-established and computationally efficient.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Limitations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Assumes linear relationship</b>: The model only works well if the underlying relationship between variables is truly linear.</li>
        <li><b>Sensitive to outliers</b>: Extreme data points can significantly skew the results.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Overall, linear regression is a powerful tool for understanding and predicting relationships between variables. It serves as a stepping stone to more complex machine learning models.</p>
